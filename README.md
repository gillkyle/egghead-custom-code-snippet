# Custom Code Snippets

Using VSCode, add code snippets that you can use as shortcuts/templates for commonly repeated segments of code.

You can add a `.code-snippets` file at `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets/custom.code-snippets` on Mac or follow the instructions in the Egghead video.
